1. Create a new .NET Core MVC application by typing dotnet new mvc
2. On your app's front-end, create a form with one (1) field that takes a given string.
3. When the form is submitted, post the value of the field to a custom API endpoint (on your app's server-side) that converts the string to a Byte Array.
4. Return the Byte Array as a JSON object in the response, printing it beneath the form field.
 
Feel free to use whatever libraries or methods you wish.
